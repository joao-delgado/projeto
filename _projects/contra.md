As a member of the students association of FBAUL, we found its old and very interesting historic archive, so we decided to do an exhibition to show it to the rest of the college students.

As a group, we curated the exhibition and launched a commemorative edition of an old fanzine of the association called “AE Informa”. It was intended to “give voice” to the students' concerns about the college.

For the exhibition I also designed de posters, the commemorative edition fanzine and managed the social media of the event.
