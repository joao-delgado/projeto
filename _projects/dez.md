Dez Magazine aims to be a magazine with ten issues, created by ten artists per issue where each one explores through photography a specific plastic related subject. In this first issue, the subject was “plastic food”.

For this project I made a website from scratch that houses the ten photography projects with their synopsis written by the artists. This magazine also has a print version, so this website tries to take advantage of the digital support with animations and interactions.

For this issue, I also did two of the ten photography projects present in this magazine.
