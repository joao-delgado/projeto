“PEN-USB/INK” is a periodic magazine that pretends to question the digital/print dichotomy. In three issues (“PEN”, “USB” and “INK”), this magazine aims to think about design through the way people receive and consume information. “PEN” wants to think about journalism and about the way, nowadays, the print media and the digital media must work closely together.

To achieve this relation, I made a website from scratch that uses “anchors” that are connected to the print publication through QR codes. In this way, we can take advantage from the two different supports to improve the reading experience.
