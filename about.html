Hi! I’m João Delgado and I'm a communication and web designer based in Lisbon, Portugal with a Communication Design degree in the Lisbon’s Fine Arts Faculty.

I’m amazed with the world of arts and how it meets with the world of technology. I’m always looking for ways to develop my critical spirit skills and, as a designer, I’m very interested to find how can I create an improved experience with the world, through the tools that I have now available.
